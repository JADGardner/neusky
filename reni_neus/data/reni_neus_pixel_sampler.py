          Does the same as collate_image_dataset_batch, except it will operate over a list of images / masks inside
          a list.

          We will use this with the intent of DEPRECIATING it as soon as we find a viable alternative.
          The intention will be to replace this with a more efficient implementation that doesn't require a for loop, but
          since pytorch's ragged tensors are still in beta (this would allow for some vectorization), this will do.
